<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m Shweta, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating sleek, functional, and user-friendly websites. I love blending creativity and code to craft digital experiences that leave a lasting impression.</p>

<p>When I’m not deep in lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Googling error messages we all pretend not to get), you can usually find me exploring new places, indulging in amazing food, or hunting down the best desserts in town—because life is too short for bad sweets!</p>

<p>I also enjoy diving into stories, whether it’s an edge-of-your-seat novel or a deep-dive non-fiction read that expands my perspective. These moments fuel my creativity and keep me inspired to bring fresh ideas to my projects.</p>

<p>Whether you’re here to collaborate, chat about your next big idea, or swap travel and dessert recommendations, I’m all ears! Let’s create something amazing together.</p>
